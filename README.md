# Scrappind Data Assignment – Grateful Dead Concerts (1990s)

## Project Overview
This project involves scraping metadata for Grateful Dead concerts from the Internet Archive, focusing on performances from the 1990s. The goal is to create a structured, machine-readable dataset suitable for analysis, research, or educational purposes.

## Files in this Repository
- `Scrappind_data_Assignment_2.py` – Python script used to scrape and process the Grateful Dead concert metadata.
- `Scrappind_data_Assignment_2.json` – JSON file containing the cleaned dataset of 1,500 concerts.
- `Scrappind_data_Assignment_2.pdf` – PDF document of the assignment submission with methodology and results.

## Data Source
- **Website:** [Internet Archive – Grateful Dead Collection](https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead)  
- **Timeframe:** 1990–1999  
- **Sample Size:** First 1,500 items from the collection.

## How to Use
1. Run `Scrappind_data_Assignment_2.py` to fetch and process the data from the Internet Archive (requires Python 3).  
2. The script generates a JSON file (`Scrappind_data_Assignment_2.json`) with structured metadata.  
3. The PDF (`Scrappind_data_Assignment_2.pdf`) documents the project methodology and results.
